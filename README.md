# Plane-Stabilizer-and-Autopilot

## General desciption

This is an automatic stabilizing and auto-piloting system designed to be run in my FPV49 RC flying wing.

It is written for the Arduino Uno/Nano R3 platform (Atmel 328p) and uses quite a few different sensoric units detailled in the next paragraph.


## Sensors currently in use

InvenSense ITG3200 3-axis gyroscope to measure angular speed
Analog Devices ADXL345 3-axis accelerometer to measure absolute rotation
Honeywell HMC5883L 3-axis magnetometer to measure the orientation of the earth's magnetic field
Bosch Sensortec BMP180 barometric pressure sensor to measure relative height

Soon to be followed by:
u-blox GPS module


## Software functions currently implemented
